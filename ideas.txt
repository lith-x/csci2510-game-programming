Hue Maze

Reference:
 - The mobile game "I Love Hue" is a game where you organize a whole bunch of
   squares in a perfect color gradient, using very few already-arranged squares
   as reference (each correct one usually being in a corner, the rest being
   scattered).


Functional ideas:
 - Start at the beginning with a color, you are presented a different color in
   each cardinal direction, click the correct one (the square that properly
   gradients from [current square] to [end square]) to proceed down a the correct
   path towards the end square.
 - Three or five strikes results in a reset.
 - NO TIME LIMIT PLEASE

 - Primary: use WASD/arrow keys to navigate which direction the maze is.
   Secondary: use the mouse to click on the squares.

Extra:
 - Once a person reaches the end, populate the rest of the grid with a
   generated maze of gradients that are different from the actual end-color.
   It'd be a cool visual effect. Not functionally necessary. Only work on it
   if there's time to.
